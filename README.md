### Some things about me you should know👆
- 🏗 I’m currently working on an App for the local music scene based on Python and Django. Just a solo project for now.
- 🌱 I’m learning about Fullstack Python development. Data analysis soon.
- 👯 I want to collaborate on cool projects based on innovative visual and inmersive proposals, which present challenges in data structuring and maintenance.
- 🪂 I’m looking for help to improve my skills about data structuring and modeling. Advanced Python too.
- 🎓 Ask me about BTL marketing and international trade and its system. I'm passionate about it and I can talk about different related topics for hours... even days. Maybe    you can learn something new.
- 😜 Fun fact: I have proficiency in shitty small ventures not related to web or software development. I had a lot and I really don't know how. Or why, but they rocked!
- 🗺 Based in Chile but I can move!
- 📚 EN | ES | et un peu de FR
